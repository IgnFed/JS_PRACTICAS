# Algorithm Excersices With JavaScript.

## The problems are the following:
* ### 1) [Anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)

      Words that have the same frequency of letters 
      but in different order.

* ### 2) [First and last index in sortered array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-first-and-last-positions-of-an-element-in-a-sorted-array/)
      
      Given an array <A> of integers and a target <K>, 
      find the first and the last index of <K> in <A>

* ### 3) [Kth largest element](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

      Given an integer array nums and an integer k, 
      return the kth largest element in the array.
  * This excersices commonly asks you the kth element,
  but my solutions return an array-type [k1,k2,...,kn] where kn is the kth element.
